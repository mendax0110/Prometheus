# Prometheus

Prometheus is a powerful and flexible C++ code transformation tool designed to process and modify C++ source code efficiently.
It integrates with Clangâ€™s AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) to identify deprecated functions and apply custom transformations.

## Features

- **AST Processing:** Analyze and modify C++ code via the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **Code Transformations:** Replace deprecated functions with modern alternatives (e.g., replacing `auto_ptr` with `std::unique_ptr`).
- **Flexible Configuration:** Dynamically choose the C++ language standard (e.g., C++11, C++14, C++17, etc.).
- **Batch Processing:** Process individual files or entire directories of C++ source code files.
- **Rewriting Code:** The program can rewrite and output transformed source code to specified directories.
- **Easy to Use:** Simple command-line interface for seamless operation.
